# MoonShakers
MoonShakers is an interactive 3D lunar globe on a web app using globe.gl API and used seismic geophysical data transmitted back to Earth by several instruments left behind by NASAâ€™s Apollo astronauts. Specifically, we used dataset named nakamura_1979_sm_locations.csv. We added data on points layer and attached ripple effect at each point to show moonquake propagation. The datasets we used contained a total of 28 moonquake locations with their times. We have taken the magnitude instead of the depth of such waves. Our approach might help people seek a greater view using a 3d digital lunar globe and seismic waves using color concentration. We have added a vibration sound effect, and actual vibration of mobile devices, making it entertaining and interactive.
